# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project creates a simple library management system using ES6 classes and advanced ES6 features. The system allows adding, removing, and searching for books, as well as managing users and their borrowed books.

- Implements methods in the `Library` class to:

  - Add a book: `addBook(book)`

  - Remove a book: `removeBook(isbn)`

  - Search for a book: `searchBook(query)`

  - Add a user: `addUser(user)`

  - Remove a user: `removeUser(id)`

  - Search for a user: `searchUser(query)`

  - Borrow a book: `borrowBook(userId, isbn)`

  - Return a book: `returnBook(userId, isbn)`

  - Check if a book is available: `isBookAvailable(isbn)`
